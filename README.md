# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice, implemented mainly in **C++**.  
The problems are organized **topic-wise** to ensure clarity, scalability, and easy navigation.

This repo reflects my **consistent problem-solving journey** and is intended for **learning, revision, and interview preparation**.
